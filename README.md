# KMP-RK algorithms Comparer:
## Introduction:
This is a simple program that helps test the running time of the KMP and RK algorithms processing the same string text.

## Use:
Start the program and enter the length of the text string and pattern string, you will see these two lines:

`Enter the size of the string (must be greater than X):`

`Enter the size of the string (must be greater than X+1):`

Then, edit your running trials :

`Enter the number of running times: `

and the program will automatically start. The yielded result looks like this:

`RK average time: 2.01654e-05 seconds, KMP average time: 2.94138e-05 seconds`

*Kind reminder: Do not insert huge numbers, it's very time-consuming!*

## Note:
1. Due to different compilers, it might generate anomalies or different results.
**Please note this difference when running it on different systems!**
2. This program is only for educational purposes!

Lastly, enjoy, and hope you have fun!
